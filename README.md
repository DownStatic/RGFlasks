RGFlasks:
  Use Flask (Python) to define an API:
    API must be restful
    Must utilize a database and not return statically generated response data
    Data will be comprised initially of a seed
  Buid Phases:
    Return statically generated dictionary in JSON
    Set up database calls and all RESTful routes
  Stretch Goals:
    Incorporate external API call for initial seed
